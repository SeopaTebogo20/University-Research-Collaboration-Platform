To discuss the problems we had on the last sprint, especially the ones that lost us marks on the first sprint. We wanted to aslo plan
how we were going to fix them.

  Requirement Engineering:
  We can't assign work and not have documentation proving that or assign work to a group and not show what was exactly given to who.

  We didn't have proof that we had meetings, we only had minutes. We should also have all meetings (Sprint Planning, Daily scrum, Sprint
  Review, Sprint Retrospective, Backlog Refinement).

  Continuous Integration:
  Releases
  Issue tracker
  Stand Alone Build
  Coverage Statuses

  Test Driven Development:
  Acceptance Test
  User Acceptance Test
  Jest(need to show Code Coverage)

  Project Polish:
  We had Errors in our verification. Phone numbers and emails were not being verified at all.


3.How to fix the problems:
  Scrum Methodology: Use discord for formal communications
  Project Polish: Fix error handling/verification
  Continuous Integration: Check issue tracking and start using it.
  Requirement Engineering: We'll write in brackets who was assigned what user story/ functionality
  if we assigned something to multiple members.
