Meeting Type: Sprint Review
Attendees: Development Team & Client

1. Purpose of the Meeting
To Review and get feedback on how we performed on the first sprint.

In this meeting the client was checking if we had done evrything well and was marking the first sprint.
We made a number of mistakes, namely: 
  Scrum Methodology: We had missing meetings (Backlog refinment, Sprint retrospective) and for some metting that we had,
  we didn't have proof.

  Continuous Integration: we didn't have a Stand Alone Build, issue tracker, and releases.
  Project Polish: We had some unhandled errors, like contact number and email not being verified.

2. Feedback
The client emphasized that we must check the rubric and we must create a Discord server to hold our meetings. We were to also make sure
to fix the errrors we had before moving forward.
